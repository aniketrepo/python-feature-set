## Class XII Practical Project- Library Management System (LMS) by Aniket Dixit 
- The purpose of this Library Management System (LMS) is to operate a library with efficiency and at reduced costs. 
- The system being entirely automated streamlines all the tasks involved in the operations of the library. 
- The activities of book borrowing, returning, and stock checking are done by the LMS solution. 
- Such software eliminates the need for repetitive manual work and minimizes the chances of errors.
- Python is used to develop the basic features of the LMS
- Book and Borower details are captures in the CSV file
