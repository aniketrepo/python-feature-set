This is the blueprint of a program which will manage my to-do-list. Here's the summary of what  it would be able to do:

1. **Read tasks from a Markdown File:**
	- Load tasks from a Markdown File `(to-do-list.md)`.
	- Identify tasks as completed or not completed.

2. **Display tasks:**
	- Print the list of tasks from the console.
	- Show the status of each task (completed or not-completed).

3. **Add new tasks:**
	- Prompt the user to add new tasks.
	- Append the new task to markdown as not-completed.

4. **Mark tasks as completed:**
	- Prompt the user to enter the number of the task to be marked as completed.
	- Update the specific task in the markdown file to show it as completed.

5. **Command-Line Interface:**
	- Provide a menu with options to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, or exit the application.
	- Loop through the menu until the user chooses to exit.
